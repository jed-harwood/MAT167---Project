# Handwritten Digit Classification

This is a term project for MAT167:Applied Linear Algebra, Fall 2021. 
All computations are performed on MATLAB.

MATLAB Toolboxes: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
MATLAB packages: 

Our objective is to find the most accurate algorithm with the lowest time complexity for classifying handwritten images out of the five algorithms: simple algorithm, k means clustering, k nearest neighbors, tangent distance, and singular value decomposition.
